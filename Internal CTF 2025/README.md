# Internal Capture the Flag 2025

An event conducted by the Asia Pacific University Forensic Security Research Center Student Section on April 19, 2025.  There were 180 teams that participated in the event and it ended as a huge success.  As a member of the challenge creator team, I've designed various challenges.  Here are the resources and solutions for my challenges.
