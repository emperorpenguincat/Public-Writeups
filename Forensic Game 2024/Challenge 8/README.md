# Title: Challenge 8

## Location: Cyber Range @APU

### Description: We intercepted the culprits' packets as they communicated about where they were hiding the money. The message appears to be encrypted,Â can you find a way to see what they are talking about and where they are hiding the money?

#### File: capturedpacket.pcapng

#### File in Cyber Range's PC: chat.txt


## Solution

Firstly, the challenge provided one pcap file called `capturedpacket.pcapng` so players should know that this challenge involve with network analysis. Tools like Wireshark is very useful for network analysis and they are pre-installed in Kali Linux. This challenge also requires the player to travel to another location which is CyberRange@APU and there's a file called `chat.txt` that contains a chat log of the three masterminds which stored inside the PCs. When the players open the pcap file, it seems that the traffic is encrypted so we need to find a way to decrypt the messages.

When players analyze the chat log, they will eventually encounter a suspicious URL link that may lead to the culprits stash.

When they enter the link, they should see that it is a dropbox that contains multiple different files such as images and text file.

However, the file that should attracts the most attention is the `SSLKEYLOG` file. This file is very important to decrypt a TLS traffic because it logged the information about the secrets used in a TLS connection. Then, players should download the file into their PC for next step.

Now that the players have the `SSLKEYLOG` file, they can decrypt the packet using `Wireshark`. For more info you can read: https://wiki.wireshark.org/TLS. When opened the Wireshark, the players should first go to `preferences`.

Then, locate to `protocols` and expand it.

After that, scroll all the way down until `TLS` is found.

In the `(Pre)-Master-Secret Log`, the players can simply browse and use the `SSLKEYLOG` file that they downloaded earlier. After completing the steps, just click OK.

The packet now should be decrypted and the HTTP protocols can be read in plaintext.

Now the players can filter the protocols by just using `HTTP` in Wireshark and find any relevant information from the packets.

Players should eventually found a suspicious image that called `location.png` from one of the HTTP stream as that is the objective of the challenge.

Now, they can try to download the image using one of the Wireshark function which is `Export Objects`.

After that, the players can download the image by simply going to the HTTP stream and export the `image/png`.

To download the image, just save the image into any of your designated folder.

Finally, the players should open up the image from the folder that they downloaded and they should be able to see the location of the place which is the flag.
